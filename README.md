# Original description
```
What is PersistentWindows?
A poorly named utility that persists window positions and size when the monitor display count/resolution adjusts 
and restores back to itâ€™s previous settings.

For those of you with multi-monitors running on a mixture of DisplayPort and any other connection, you can run 
this tool and not have to worry about re-arranging when all is back to normal.

```
# Key features 
- Keeps track of window position change in real time for each monitor setup, and automatically restores window layout with matching monitor setup.
- Support remote desktop session with multiple virtual monitor resolutions.
- Can be run as Windows startup job.
- Starting from V4.1, window position can be manually saved to persistent database on hard drive, making it possible to revert unintended or temporary window moves, or restore closed windows even after reboot.

# Installation
- Download the latest PersistentWindows*.zip file from https://github.com/kangyu-california/PersistentWindows/releases
- Unzip the file into any directory
- Optionally create a shortcut to PersistentWindows.exe in C:\Users\\<your_user_id>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup to automatically start the program when computer powers up.

# Use instructions
- Run PersistentWindows.exe as normal user, a splash window will pop up, indicating the program has started successfully.
- Some applications (such as Task Manager, WSL console etc) do require running PersistentWindows with admin privilege in order to be movable.
- PersistentWindows minimizes itself as an icon in the systray area on task bar.
- To save current window layout to persistent storage, right click the icon and select "Capture windows to disk" 
- To restore saved window layout from persistent storage, or to recover closed windows after reboot, right click the icon and select "Restore windows from disk"
- To help restoring taskbar window, make sure taskbar is unlocked (i.e. it can be dragged using mouse), also please do NOT move mouse during window recovery.
